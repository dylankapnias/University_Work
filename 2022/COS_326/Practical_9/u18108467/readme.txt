COS326 Practical 9 - Dylan Kapnias (u18108467)

### The following steps assume that you are in the root folder of the project i.e., u18108467/

- Move into the Application directory, the project can be run by using the following command:
  'java -cp prac9-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar up.prac9.Prac9'

- Once run, if there is no db directory in the current folder (Application/), the program will create it
  and the new database. If you would like to use a currently existing database, before executing the
  program, create a directory name 'db/' in the Application directory, then move the database into that folder,
  whilst ensuring that the database is of the type .odb, and the name is 'COS326_Prac1.odb'
